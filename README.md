# code_template
Some code templates to make my life easier, this repository aims to speed up the data exploration and modeling processes by reducing coding time by setting up a set of functions with reference to [SEMMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMMA) approach. Of cource, there would be more then the scope of this SEMMA.

The phases of SEMMA and related tasks are the following
- Sample
